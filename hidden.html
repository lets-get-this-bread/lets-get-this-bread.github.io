	<p>Hello! If you are here, that means you may be in need of help. We are not an actual bakery, but instead, a fake one to help you escape your situation. Whenever you call or text us at (609) 256-6938, we will be able to keep track of what's going on. You can text us whatever you want, and when you send us a text, our number will call you back immediately.</p>

	<p>When you pick up our call, you will be put "on hold" with a customer service representative (who is actually an automated voice). While you are waiting, the entirety of your call will be recorded. (Note that if you live in a state where "Two-Party Consent Laws" exist for phone call recordings, we will not be able to call you.)</p>

	<p>The recording will end once your call ends. After the recording ends, it will be stored in a secure database and can be sent to authorities if needed.</p>
